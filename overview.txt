1) src -> ingest_data , etc (all logic is written here using abstractclass and abstractmethod)

2) analyze -> EDA 

3) steps -> step functions for all src files that will be imported in the training_pipeline

4) Pipelines -> training_pipeline -> pipeline containing all the steps from steps
                run_pipeline -> import the training_pipeline and then run this, after that do  zenml up --blocking
